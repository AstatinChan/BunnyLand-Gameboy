Bugs:
 ? - Object loading after being in view
 ? - Kill before or after attack
   - Reset to title screen on spamming A (?) while boom animation starting (recording recordings/2026-01-21T16\:40\:32+01\:00.record, commit c286a81)
   - Sometimes going out of the big menu stucks in palette dark for some reason
   - During screen reload, the music slows down/glitches a bit

Accessibility issues:
  -> freeze/earcopter attack patterns are not obvious (either needs to be shown on map or add select menu with infos if not possible + tutorial to explain the existence of select menu ?)
  -> There is no indicator that the max health is 20
 ? -> B + arrow is not obvious (tutorial ?)
 x -> when stairs spawn in the same room as the bunny, it's not obvious that it's not the stairs we just came from

Need to be refactored:
  -> general structure is messy (why is Update_Animation_Step in entity/action.gbasm ?? What is even entity/action.gbasm supposed to be ??)
  -> split fox turn into multiple subfunction that could be reused in other enemies turns functions
  -> create an enemy turns thingy directory, move attacks inside of entity/enemies (both enemiesattacks and playerattacks)
  -> tiles are duplicated in the tree tilelset and could be reduce to 32 tiles

Medium term:
  -> Add special attacks/capacities to the bunny
x	* Jump x2 (even over an enemy) (attacking or not ?)
	* Stronger attack
x	* Weaker attack on multiple foxes
x	* Freeze a/multiple fox(es) for X turns
	* Distance attack (maybe reuse laser of the enemies)

x -> Limit attacks uses

x -> Spawn enemies in far away rooms when less than X enemies on the map. (Maybe despawn some too)

x -> Add objects to heal

x -> Add objects get back limited use attacks/learn new attacks

x -> Add attacks for the foxes

x -> Add other types of enemies

  -> Add more enemies & enemy behaviours:
x	* Fox with distance limited attack and close unlimited attack
x	* Penguin freezing and fleeing when the player is frozen
x	* Mouse weaker and only close attacks but can move 2x faster
x	* Cats being normal (only close attacks)
	* Fimsh
x		* being super rare (have a bunch of HP), not do anything
		* but drop super cool objects
	* Owls heal the enemies around (different pathfinding where it tries to stay 1 block away from the bnuy?) + cooldown
x	* Bugs move 2x faster and sacrifice themselves to give the bunny a status (poisoned & taking damages/slower and skipping one of 2 turns)
x	* Frogs: Can grab bunny to them

x -> Have some enemies drop items

x -> Add floor count + a kind of goal (rescuing another bunny/getting a rare item ?)

  -> Music (https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace/)

DEMO



  -> Allow enemy to join your team after beating/with an item/after completing a quest

  -> Get a safe place (not procedurally generated) with friends where we can get quests and choose to explore dungeons. (Firecamp with friends around)
		-> Thing for going on adventures
		-> Place where you sleep (firecamp)
		-> Save feature

x -> Find a way to control the difficulty level so its easier at the start and harder at the end.


  -> We meet a human
	-> human is stuck in a world with only animals and has been there for a long time
	-> earthquakes have been happening more and more recently
	-> human likes to go help animals in need, the earthquake have caused more and more disasters to happen overtime
	-> we make a team with human (we are only two at the beginning, but story quests will introduce new characters)
	-> but when speaking to human, it is apparent that human is missing home, but gave up on it a long time ago
	-> it becomes more and more obvious the earthquakes are caused by some evil person
	-> someone is kidnapped by the evil person, we go to rescue them but the kidnappers have setup a trap and human realises it and "sacrifices themselves" to make sure we are surviving
	-> Everyone is teaming up to go rescue human from a seemingly hopeless situation
	-> We manage after of danger and effort to rescue human
	-> We learn the evil person is actually not the cause of the earthquakes but trying to do something good with it and the earthquakes are natural
	-> Human realises that they became nihilistic and in wanting to save others, forgot to save themselves and actually really miss home and want now to find their way out
	-> all pieces get together and it somehow means the earthquakes can somehow be used to send the human back home
	-> human stop giving up
	-> things happening (very linearly very fast and people are excited)
	-> Human finally find their way home and go back in an emotional goodbye
	-> end

THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING RELATED TO EARTHQUAKES


-> In practice:
	-> At the start, campsite is empty.
	-> Dialogue for the thoughts of the bunny explains that we want the golden celery
	-> We go to a very short dungeon (~3 floors) to collect the golden celery

	-> We come back to the camping site, and we sleep
	-> Thoughts dialogue explain that we want to explore a new part of the forest (no specific goal)
	-> When arriving at the dungeon, we hear a voice calling (like rn but without the "10th floor")
	-> We meet tin at the X floor
	-> (From now on, no more thought dialogue)
	-> Tin explains they have been in this place for a while
	-> We suggest to bring them back to the campsite
	-> We "show" (talk) the campsite, they get excited
	-> And then we sleep

# Lonely grove

-> 1st floor:
	"Heeeeeelp"
	You heard someone cry for help

-> 10th floor
	TIN: Hi
	TIN: Was I the one crying for help ?
	TIN: I'm sorry I'm not who you're looking for.
	TIN: I was just...
	TIN: Having a walk I guess ?

	**BOOOOOOOOM**

	TIN: What was that ?!
	TIN: It's coming from over there !
	TIN: Follow me !

*11th floor*
Custom corridor/ kinda similar to basecamp floor with a mouse trapped at the end surrounded by holes we cannot currently jump over but will be able to when we beat the 3 foxes that are in the room

**more shaking BOOM stuff**

	TIN: There's someone over there ! We need to save them !
