Bugs:

Accessibility issues:
  -> freeze/earcopter attack patterns are not obvious (either needs to be shown on map or add select menu with infos if not possible + tutorial to explain the existence of select menu ?)
  -> There is no indicator that the max health is 20
  -> B + arrow is not obvious (tutorial ?)
  -> when stairs spawn in the same room as the bunny, it's not obvious that it's not the stairs we just came from

Need to be refactored:
  -> main is messy and unreadable
  -> rework mode checks (heatlh update should happen on both dungeon and dead mode)
  -> general structure is messy (why is Update_Animation_Step in entity/action.gbasm ?? What is even entity/action.gbasm supposed to be ??)
  -> split fox turn into multiple subfunction that could be reused in other enemies turns functions
  -> create an enemy turns thingy directory, move attacks inside of entity/enemies (both enemiesattacks and playerattacks)
  -> tiles are duplicated in the tree tilelset and could be reduce to 32 tiles

Medium term:
  -> Add special attacks/capacities to the bunny
x	* Jump x2 (even over an enemy) (attacking or not ?)
	* Stronger attack
x	* Weaker attack on multiple foxes
x	* Freeze a/multiple fox(es) for X turns
	* Distance attack (maybe reuse laser of the enemies)

x -> Limit attacks uses

x -> Spawn enemies in far away rooms when less than X enemies on the map. (Maybe despawn some too)

x -> Add objects to heal

  -> Add objects get back limited use attacks/learn new attacks

x -> Add attacks for the foxes

x -> Add other types of enemies

  -> Add more enemies & enemy behaviours:
x	* Fox with distance limited attack and close unlimited attack
x	* Penguin freezing and fleeing when the player is frozen
	* Mouse weaker and only close attacks but can move 2x faster
x	* Cats being normal (only close attacks)
	* Fimsh being super rare have a bunch of HP, not do anything but drop super cool objects
	* Owls heal the enemies around (different pathfinding where it tries to stay 1 block away from the bnuy?) + cooldown
	* Bugs move 2x faster and sacrifice themselves to give the bunny a status (poisoned & taking damages/slower and skipping one of 2 turns)
	* Frogs: ?

  -> Have some enemies drop items

x -> Add floor count + a kind of goal (rescuing another bunny/getting a rare item ?)

DEMO

  -> Allow enemy to join your team after beating/with an item/after completing a quest

  -> Get a safe place (not procedurally generated) with friends where we can get quests and choose to explore dungeons

  -> Find a way to control the difficulty level so its easier at the start and harder at the end.

  -> (For far future, maybe make a story)
