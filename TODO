	* Jump x2 (even over an enemy) (attacking or not ?)
	* Stronger attack
	* Weaker attack on multiple foxes
	* Freeze a/multiple fox(es) for X turns
	-> All with limited number of uses

-> Add objects to heal and get back limited use attacks/learn new attacks

-> Add attacks for the foxes

-> Add other types of enemies (some stronger and some weaker/fleeing)

-> Have some enemies drop items

-> Allow enemy to join your team after beating/with an item/after completing a quest

-> Get a safe place (not procedurally generated) with friends where we can get quests and choose to explore dungeons

-> Find a way to control the difficulty level so its easier at the start and harder at the end.

-> (For far future, maybe make a story)
